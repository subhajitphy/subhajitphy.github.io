excerpt: 'We compute the third post-Newtonian (3PN) accurate instantaneous contributions to the radiated gravitational wave energy and angular momentum arising from the hyperbolic passages of nonspinning compact objects. The present computations employ 3PN-accurate instantaneous contributions to the far-zone energy and angular momentum fluxes and the 3PN-accurate Keplerian type parametric solution for compact binaries in hyperbolic orbits.'
