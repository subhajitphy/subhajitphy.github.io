Hello! I am a third-year Graduate (Ph.D.) student in the [Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://www.tifr.res.in/~daa/), [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](https://main.tifr.res.in/), Mumbai working with [Prof. A. Gopakumar](https://inspirehep.net/literature?sort=mostrecent&size=25&page=1&q=GOPAKUMAR%20ACHAMVEEDU). 
My research work mainly focuses on modeling Hecto and Nano-Hertz Gravitational-wave sources and their observational implications.
I am also a member of the [Indian Pulsar Timing Array](http://inpta.iitr.ac.in/), [LIGO Scientific Collaboration](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/) collaboration and the [International Pulsar Timing Array](http://ipta4gw.org/) consortium.
