Hi there! As an astrophysicist, my work revolves around studying gravitational waves and pulsars. Specifically, I focus on Nano and Hecto hertz Gravitational Wave (GW) astronomy using Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA) and Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) respectively. My research centers on identifying astrophysical sources of gravitational waves, GW data analysis, and developing software packagesÂ that will be useful to search for some special classes of events in GW data.

I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/), working in the Gravitational Wave and Astrophysics group led by [Dr. Alvin Chua](https://www.physics.nus.edu.sg/faculty/chua-alvin-jk/). I completed my Ph.D. at [Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://www.tifr.res.in/~daa/), [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](https://main.tifr.res.in/), Mumbai where I worked with [Prof. A. Gopakumar](https://inspirehep.net/literature?sort=mostrecent&size=25&page=1&q=GOPAKUMAR%20ACHAMVEEDU). I did my integrated BS-MS at [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal](https://www.iiserb.ac.in/). 

I am also a member of the [Indian Pulsar Timing Array](http://inpta.iitr.ac.in/), [LIGO Scientific Collaboration](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/), and the [International Pulsar Timing Array](http://ipta4gw.org/) consortium.
