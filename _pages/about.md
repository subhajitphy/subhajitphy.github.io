Hi there! As an astrophysicist, my work revolves around studying gravitational waves and pulsars. Specifically, I focus on Hecto and Nanohertz Gravitational Wave (GW) astronomy using Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and  Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA) respectively. My research centers on identifying astrophysical sources of Hecto and Nanohertz gravitational waves, GW data analysis, and developing software packages that will be useful to search for some special classes of events in GW data.

I did my integrated BS-MS at [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal](https://www.iiserb.ac.in/). Currently, I am a 4th-year Graduate (Ph.D.) student in the [Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://www.tifr.res.in/~daa/), [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](https://main.tifr.res.in/), Mumbai working with [Prof. A. Gopakumar](https://inspirehep.net/literature?sort=mostrecent&size=25&page=1&q=GOPAKUMAR%20ACHAMVEEDU).

I am also a member of the [Indian Pulsar Timing Array](http://inpta.iitr.ac.in/), [LIGO Scientific Collaboration](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/) collaboration, and the [International Pulsar Timing Array](http://ipta4gw.org/) consortium.
