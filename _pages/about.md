Hi there! As an astrophysicist, my work revolves around studying gravitational waves and pulsars. Specifically, I focus on Nano and Hecto hertz Gravitational Wave (GW) astronomy using Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA) and Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) respectively. My research centers on identifying astrophysical sources of gravitational waves, GW data analysis, and developing software packages that will be useful to search for some special classes of events in GW data.

I did my integrated BS-MS at [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal](https://www.iiserb.ac.in/). Currently, I am a 4th-year Graduate (Ph.D.) student in the [Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://www.tifr.res.in/~daa/), [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](https://main.tifr.res.in/), Mumbai working with [Prof. A. Gopakumar](https://inspirehep.net/literature?sort=mostrecent&size=25&page=1&q=GOPAKUMAR%20ACHAMVEEDU).

I am also a member of the [Indian Pulsar Timing Array](http://inpta.iitr.ac.in/), [LIGO Scientific Collaboration](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/) collaboration, and the [International Pulsar Timing Array](http://ipta4gw.org/) consortium.
