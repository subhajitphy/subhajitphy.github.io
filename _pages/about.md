## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

As a **computational astrophysicist**, my work revolves around **modeling** and **detecting individual gravitational wave (GW) sources**. I primarily focus on **nanohertz GW astronomy** using **Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs)**. My research involves **identifying astrophysical GW sources**, **developing robust data analysis pipelines**, and **building specialized software packages** to detect **rare classes of signals** in noisy GW datasets.

Currently, my scientific interests have expanded toward the application of **modern Machine Learning (ML)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** techniques to **GW data analysis** â€” aiming to **enhance source modeling**, **improve signal detection**, and **accelerate inference** in complex astrophysical scenarios, particularly in the context of PTAs.

I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/), working in the Gravitational Wave and Astrophysics group led by [Dr. Alvin Chua](https://www.physics.nus.edu.sg/faculty/chua-alvin-jk/). I completed my Ph.D. at [Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://www.tifr.res.in/~daa/), [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](https://main.tifr.res.in/), Mumbai where I worked with [Prof. A. Gopakumar](https://inspirehep.net/literature?sort=mostrecent&size=25&page=1&q=GOPAKUMAR%20ACHAMVEEDU). I did my integrated BS-MS at [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal](https://www.iiserb.ac.in/). 

I am also a member of the [Indian Pulsar Timing Array](http://inpta.iitr.ac.in/), the [International Pulsar Timing Array](http://ipta4gw.org/) consortium, and a former member of the [LIGO Scientific Collaboration](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/).
